<div id="mission">

Victory Parade's mission is to improve health outcomes for equine athletes by utilizing the latest computer vision and machine learning techniques.
<p/>
<h3>About us:</h3>
We've assembled an impressive team of computer vision experts, veterinarians, technologists, and investors to help bring about a technological revolution in equine health care.
<p/>
In the 1880's Eadweard Muybridge used recent technological advances to answer questions about the gait of a horse at a gallop.  We're doing the same, bringing new insights and ways to analyze equine movement.

		Rachel is the co-founder and Chief Veterinary Officer of Victory Parade.
		She grew up riding horses and competed nationally on the hunter-jumper show circuit.
		Her first degree was in computer engineering at Tufts University.  After 5 years
		working in software, she went back to school to become a veterinarian, at the Royal
		Veterinary College in London.  Summer research during school involved analyzing mouse gaits, building a mouse treadmill, and running horses on treadmills, which inspired some of the ideas leading us to create Victory Parade.  She is currently working as a small animal veterinarian.
		
		<p/>  When not in the hospital, she can be found baking, running, or petting dogs.
